# Checkpoint: ralph-tui PRD Reviews
# Generated: 2026-01-15T04:20:00Z

goal: |
  Review all 3 ralph-tui PRD sessions using rp-cli to verify implementation quality:
  1. GMP Bug Fixes PRD (7 tasks)
  2. MS Multi-Profile PRD (9 tasks)
  3. MS DisplayName Rename PRD (12 tasks)

now: |
  Completed reviews of all 3 PRDs. Created beads for critical issues found.
  Major finding: Multi-Profile PRD marked 100% complete but ZERO implementation.

outcome: PARTIAL_PLUS

done_this_session:
  - Reviewed GMP PRD via rp-cli - found 2 incomplete, 1 unverifiable, 2 partial
  - Reviewed MS Multi-Profile PRD - found ALL 9 tasks unimplemented (false positives)
  - Reviewed MS DisplayName PRD - found cloud sync gap (local works, no GCS upload)
  - Created bead groovetech-media-server-0ct (P1) - displayName cloud sync missing
  - Created bead groovetech-media-server-7kv (P0) - Multi-Profile ZERO implementation
  - Created bead groovetech-media-player-5q5 (P1) - GMP incomplete implementations
  - Saved detailed review to thoughts/shared/handoffs/events/2026-01-15T16-06-41_displayname-review.md
  - Synced all beads to remote

next:
  - Fix displayName cloud sync (groovetech-media-server-0ct)
  - Implement Multi-Profile PRD from scratch (groovetech-media-server-7kv)
  - Fix GMP incomplete tasks (groovetech-media-player-5q5)
  - Add validation to ralph-tui to verify actual code changes before marking complete
  - Restore ralph skill from ~/dev/ralph-loop/pi-integration/skill/SKILL.md

worked:
  - rp-cli plan mode excellent for code review against PRD requirements
  - Creating beads immediately after finding issues preserves context
  - Cross-repo analysis revealed integration gaps (MS→GCS→GMP flow)

failed:
  - opencode agent marked tasks complete without implementation (Multi-Profile)
  - opencode agent missed cloud sync integration (DisplayName)
  - ralph-tui lacks verification step before marking tasks complete

blockers: []

  repos_reviewed:

  beads_created:
    - groovetech-media-server-0ct (P1, displayName cloud sync)
    - groovetech-media-server-7kv (P0, Multi-Profile zero impl)
    - groovetech-media-player-5q5 (P1, GMP incomplete)
  rp_cli_workspace: 1 (groovetech-media-server)

resume_hint: |
  Start with groovetech-media-server-7kv (P0) - the Multi-Profile PRD needs
  complete implementation from scratch. Use the detailed implementation plan
  in the rp-cli review output. Consider running ralph-tui again with proper
  verification or implementing manually.
